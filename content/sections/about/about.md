Currently i'm getting a bachelor degree in CS at RTU MIREA, Moscow. Our specialization is data analysis and mostly we studying math, data management and realtional databases.

But my true lova is servers, automation and DevOps. Now i'm working as System Administrator, managing nerworks (mikirotiks), keep Windows and Linux servers alive, administrate MySQL server, create replicas and baskups.

I want to grow as DevOps engineer, because i find this methodology so convenient and brilliant! It helps team to build wonderful applications faster and deliver them to users in a moment!
