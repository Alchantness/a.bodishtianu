Hey, I'm Artem, your tech enthusiast for making systems run seamlessly. Armed with a Computer Science degree at MIREA university, I'm not just your typical techie â€“ I've got a knack for Python programming, Linux systems, databases, and IT process management. Currently striving to become a DevOps engineer, I find joy in automating processes and ensuring everything ticks like clockwork.

Aspiring to be a DevOps pro, I'm dedicated to using automation to enhance system reliability, speed up software deployment, and optimize all things tech. Always staying up-to-date with the latest in IT, I'm ready for the challenges of the ever-evolving tech landscape, especially in the realm of security.
