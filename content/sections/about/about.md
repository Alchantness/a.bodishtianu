Currently i'm getting a bachelor degree in CS at RTU MIREA, Moscow. Our specialization is data analysis and mostly we studying math, data management and realational databases.

But my true love is servers, automation and DevOps. Now i'm working as System Administrator, managing nerworks (mikirotiks), keep Windows and Linux servers alive, administrate MySQL, create replicas and backups.

I want to grow as DevOps engineer, because i find this methodology so convenient and brilliant! It help teams to build wonderful applications faster and deliver them to users in a moment!
