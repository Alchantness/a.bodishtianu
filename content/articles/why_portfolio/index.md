## For what?
In the process of studying, I met with a problem with the confirmation of my knowledge. This is usually achieved through practice, for example at work or in your personal tasks. I don't run into that, unfortunately. And I got the idea to write a blog, where I would rather personally explain to myself all my accumulated knowledge. Plus, it's a great idea for a portfolio site! Recruiters will immediately be able to see what exactly I am interested in, what I do and what exactly my skills are. And writing a website in 2022 is not difficult at all.

## About site

When I was thinking about the site, I wanted to go the hard way: my own design, layout myself, setting up the backend, and so on. Like, it will show my skills better. But still, I came to the conclusion that it is much faster, easier and faster to use some kind of site generators. This market is very huge, the choice is endless. After 100 hours of googling, I came to Gatsby. It's wonderful! A large number of starter templates, detailed documentation, React, Grafcl. In addition to this, ready-made integration with well-known cloud services and providers. Your site can be ready in a couple of clicks! And instead of developing the site, I can work on my projects, develop further as a devops specialist. By the way, the site is under construction, but here I will also post my projects and ideas! Both in blogs and links to github. If you want to leave your opinion, write to the mail! I think I'll add comments later.

### Summary

Building your own site portfolio is really good idea! It can help you to show your skills, to write blogs and connect with people! Go on and build too! I would really love to see your site also. So feel free to share it!
